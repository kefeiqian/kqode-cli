# TUI agent instructions

## Terminal layout

Keep the cwd row, prompt composer, and command/status row stuck to the bottom of the terminal for every shell window size. Keep exactly one blank separator row between the body area and cwd row, but do not let body, preview, or header content push gaps between the composer and the command/status row.

The prompt composer starts as one row and grows only when the current prompt text needs soft wrapping or validation feedback. When changing composer, body, header, or resize behavior, preserve this dynamic row shifting so long prompts expand the composer while short prompts keep the command/status row directly underneath.

Prompt cursor placement is manually resolved with Ink's cursor API, so it can drift when vertical layout math changes. When changing body height, spacer rows, wrapping rows, validation rows, background rows, cwd/composer/status placement, or `cursorTop` math, explicitly verify the cursor still lands on the active composer text row rather than one row above or on the cwd row.
